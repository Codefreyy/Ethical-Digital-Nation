### Ethical Digital Nation Collaborative Web Application

This repository contains the demo code for the Ethical Digital Nation Collaborative Web Application project. The project aims to address the digital divide through the development of a centralized web application for collaboration and knowledge exchange, aligned with Scotland's vision of an 'Ethical Digital Nation'.

At this stage, I have implemented an authentication feature. This allows users to:

- Create and manage their own accounts.
- Verify their identity.

The authentication functionality is crucial for enabling personalized and secure interactions within the application, supporting features like file upload and sharing.
